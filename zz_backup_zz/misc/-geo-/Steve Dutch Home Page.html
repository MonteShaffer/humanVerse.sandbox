                1976.</a> <br>
              How I got to see this event from the World Trade Center is
              a classic case of being at the right place at the right
              time. Actually, my wife was at the right place at the
              right time, proving it's not <i>what </i>you know, but <i>who</i>
              you know. Considering that millions of people saw this
              event, amazingly, there does not seem to be another photo
              archive like this on the Web.</li>

          <h2>My Web Philosophy</h2>
          <p>We've all heard that a million monkeys banging on a million
            typewriters will eventually reproduce the entire works of
            Shakespeare. Now, thanks to the Internet, we know thit is
            not true. (Robert Wilensky)</p>
          <p>Because according to the internet, Ron Paul will be
            President and Serenity is the best movie evah (Fizzyland)</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>It's not so much surfing as Dumpster-Diving.</b> I
              used to wonder how bad it could be if we just let anybody
              publish their ideas. Now I know. <i>Real</i> bad. </li>
            <li><b>I like computers.</b> I am awed by them. I am
              delighted by what they can do. <i>But I don't trust them!</i>
              Electronic storage is ephemeral and fragile. Not all of
              that is bad. The useful half-life of most information is a
              few years. But I do not assume I will always have a Web to
              access or even floppy disks to read. If I find some useful
              information, I download it. If it's really important, I
              may even make a hard copy. If a national emergency breaks
              down our telecommunications, the Web is history. If a
              rogue nation or terrorist sets off a nuclear weapon 100
              miles above the U.S., most P.C.'s are history (check out
              something called EMP). I still have a slide rule. </li>
            <li>graphics? GRAPHICS? <b>WE DON' NEED NO STINKING
                GRAPHICS!</b> Too many Web pages are cluttered with
              useless graphics (eye candy). See this campus's web page
              for a case in point. See how long it takes you to figure
              out what classes we offer, where, and when. In case you're
              not aware of it, data storage and transmission capacity
              are finite resources. Given the spatial nature of geology
              and some of my avocational interests like geometry and
              polyhedra, I have a <i>lot</i> of graphics, but I try to
              keep them to the necessary minimum in number and
              simplicity. Drawings are mostly 16-color, with no sound or
              unnecessary animation, to keep download time short and
              keep material accessible to users with low-end systems.
              Photos are standard JPEG format, 24-bit color. </li>
            <li><b>Chunky, not creamy. </b>I figure if you're looking
              for information you want to get it, so my pages tend to be
              on the long side, rather than broken into short segments
              connected by links. It may take longer to download the
              page, but once you do, everything is there. Nothing is
              more infuriating to me than to burrow six levels deep into
              a site only to find out that what I need isn't there.</li>
            <li><b>Links.</b> I know where my own stuff is. I have
              enough to do keeping track of my own pages without
              worrying if somebody else paid his Compuserve bill. I have
              had enough experiences chasing from one site to another,
              only to reach a dead end or have a crash, to conclude that
              links to remote sites are often useless. If I use them,
              they will go as directly as possible to the item of
              interest. Unless it's a stable site, like a government
              agency, I won't link to it. (Even some agency sites have
              shut down, and sites are being reorganized all the time.)
              In most cases, if I am aware of sites of interest, I will
              mention them so you can look them up with a search engine.
              <b>For this reason, I don't cross-link.</b></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Citations</h2>
          <p>I occasionally get requests from people who want to use
            material from this site but who want a formal citation. In
            general, works that are integral to the page are cited. If
            there is no citation on the page, it's for one of two
            principal reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The content is my original work but not published in a
              journal. <b>There is no other reference.</b></li>
            <li>The content is covered in many sources (for example the
              pages on stereonet constructions or structural geology
              methods) and any of those standard works are suitable
              citations.</li>
          </ul>

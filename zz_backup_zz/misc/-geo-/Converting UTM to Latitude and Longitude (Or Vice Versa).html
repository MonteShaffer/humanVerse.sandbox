<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180216112824/http://www.uwgb.edu:80/dutchs/UsefulData/OddGrids.HTM">Help! My Data Doesn't Look Like A UTM Grid!</a></p>
<p>I get enough inquiries on this subject that I decided to create a page for
it.</p>
<p>Caution! Unlike latitude and longitude, there is no physical frame of
reference for UTM grids. Latitude is determined by the earth's polar axis.
Longitude is determined by the earth's rotation. If you can see the stars and
have a sextant and a good clock set to Greenwich time, you can find your
latitude and longitude. But there is no way to determine your UTM coordinates
except by calculation.</p>
<p>UTM grids, on the other hand, are created by laying a square grid on the
earth. This means that different maps will have different grids depending on the
datum used (model of the shape of the earth). I saw US military maps of Germany
shift their UTM grids by about 300 meters when a more modern datum was used for
the maps. Also, old World War II era maps of Europe apparently used a single grid
for all of Europe and grids in some areas are wildly tilted with respect to
latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>Previously, the two basic references for converting UTM and geographic coordinates 
were
U.S. Geological
Survey Professional Paper 1395 and U. S. Army
Technical Manual TM 5-241-8 (complete citations below). Each has advantages and
disadvantages.&nbsp;These have been entirely superseded by Charles F. F. Karney (2010)
<em>Transverse Mercator with an accuracy of a few nanometers</em>. 
(arXiv:1002.1417)</p>
<h2>Converting Between Decimal Degrees, Degrees, Minutes and Seconds, and
Radians</h2>
<p><b>(dd + mm/60 +ss/3600) to Decimal degrees (dd.ff)</b></p>
<p>dd = whole degrees, mm = minutes, ss = seconds</p>
<p>dd.ff = dd + mm/60 + ss/3600</p>
<p>Example: 30 degrees 15 minutes 22 seconds = 30 + 15/60 + 22/3600 = 30.2561</p>
<p><b>Decimal degrees (dd.ff) to (dd + mm/60 +ss/3600)</b></p>
<p>For the reverse conversion, we want to convert dd.ff to dd mm ss. Here ff =
the fractional part of a decimal degree.</p>
<p>mm = 60*ff</p>
<p>ss = 60*(fractional part of mm)</p>
<p>Use only the whole number part of mm in the final result.</p>
<p>30.2561 degrees = 30 degrees</p>
<p>.2561*60 = 15.366 minutes</p>
<p>.366 minutes = 22 seconds, so the final result is 30 degrees 15 minutes 22
seconds</p>
<p><b>Decimal degrees (dd.ff) to Radians</b></p>
<p>Radians = (dd.ff)*pi/180</p>
<p><b>Radians to Decimal degrees (dd.ff)</b></p>
<p>(dd.ff) = Radians*180/pi</p>
<p><b>Degrees, Minutes and Seconds to Distance</b></p>
<p>A degree of longitude at the equator is 111.2 kilometers. A minute is 1853
meters. A second is 30.9 meters. For other latitudes multiply by cos(lat).
Distances for degrees, minutes and seconds<b> </b>in latitude are very similar
and differ very slightly with latitude. (Before satellites, observing those
differences was a principal method for determining the exact shape of the
earth.)</p>
<h2>Converting Latitude and Longitude to UTM</h2>
<p>Okay, take a deep breath. This will get <i>very</i>  complicated, but the
math, although tedious, is only algebra and trigonometry.&nbsp;It would sure be
nice if someone wrote a spreadsheet to do this. Or 
better yet, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180216112824/http://www.uwgb.edu:80/dutchs/UsefulData/ConvertUTMNoOZ.HTM">Javascript page.</a></p>

<p>Don't interpret the chart to mean there is radical disagreement about the
shape of the earth. The earth isn't perfectly round, it isn't even a perfect 
ellipsoid, and slightly different
shapes work better for some regions than for the earth as a whole. The top three
are based on worldwide data and are truly global. Also, you are very unlikely to
find UTM grids based on any of the earlier projections.</p>
<p>The most modern datums (jars my Latinist sensibilities since the plural of <i>datum</i>
in Latin is <i>data</i>, but that has a different meaning to us) are NAD83 and
WGS84. These are based in turn on GRS80. Differences between the three systems
derive mostly from redetermination of station locations rather than differences 
in the datum. Unless you are locating a first-order station to sub-millimeter 
accuracy (in which case you are way beyond the scope of this page) you can 
probably regard them as essentially identical.</p>
<h3>The NAD83 and WGS84 datums</h3>
	<p>NIMA Technical Report 8350.2 states:</p>
	<blockquote>The WGS 84 Ellipsoid is for all practical purposes identical to the GRS 
	80 ellipsoid. They use the same value for the semi-major axis and have the 
	same orientation with respect to the center of mass and the coordinate 
	system origin. .... The difference between the GRS 80 and WGS 84 values for 
	f creates a difference of 0.1 mm in the derived semi-minor [polar] axes of 
	the two ellipsoids. </blockquote>
	<blockquote>Based on these definitions, geodetic positions determined with respect to 
	NAD 83 or WGS 84 have uncertainties of about one meter in each component. 
	For mapping, charting and navigation, the two systems are 
	indistinguishable at scales of 1:5,000 or smaller and with accuracies of 
	about 2 m.</blockquote>
<h2>Formulas For Converting Latitude and Longitude to UTM</h2>
<p>Earlier versions of this page were written based on Army and USGS references. 
It has been updated according to the 
formulas of Karney (2010), which are accurate to within nanometers. The Army and 
USGS references are now obsolete. Refer to the Appendix for the Army and USGS formulas.</p>
	<p>First step, project the ellipsoid onto a sphere and compute the <em>
	conformal latitude </em>(lat'). In the formulas below, sinh and tanh are <em>
	hyperbolic functions</em>, which behave much like regular trigonometric 
	functions. They are pretty docile and do not bite if not provoked. 
	"Argsinh," etc. are analogous to arcsin, etc and are <em>inverse hyperbolic 
	functions.</em> 
	The hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions are standard in pretty much 
	all programming languages. The quantity e = SQRT(f(2-f), where f is the 
	flattening of the ellipsoid.</p>
	<p>argsinh tan lat′ = argsinh tan lat − e argtanh(e sin lat).</p>
	<p>We can solve for tan lat': tan lat' = sinh(argsinh tan lat − e argtanh(e 
	sin lat))</p>
	<p>It's convenient to work with tangents, so define tau = tan lat and tau' = 
	tan lat'</p>
	<p>Define sigma = sinh(e argtanh(e tau/SQRT(1 + tau^2)))</p>
	<p>tau' = tau SQRT(1 + sigma^2) - sigma SQRT(1 + tau^2) </p>
	<p>Now we can define xi' = arctan(tau'/cos long) and eta' = argsinh(sin 
	(long/SQRT(tau'^2 + (cos long)^2)))</p>
	<p>Somewhat confusingly, xi refers to the north south direction</p>
	<p>The next step requires some series computations. We need to define:</p>
	<p>A = a/( 1 + n ) (1 + (¼) n^2 + (1/64)n^4 + (1/256)n^6 + (25/16384)n^8 + (49/65536)n^10 + ...), 
	defines the scale of the ellipse. 
	2piA= circumference of meridian.</p>

	<p>Now we calculate:</p>
	<p>xi = xi' + SUM(αj sin 2j xi' cosh 2j eta') and eta = eta' + SUM(αj cos 2j

	<p>We can then obtain tau' = sin xi'/SQRT(sinh(eta')^2 + cos(xi')^2) and 
	long = arctan(sinh eta'/cos xi')</p>
	<p>We can invert the forward formulas to obtain: tau SQRT(1 + sigma^2) - 
	sigma SQRT(1 + tau^2) - tau' = 0. </p>
	<p>There are two problems: tau is the unknown and sigma is a function of 
	tau. So we have to resort to approximation methods. Newton's Method works 
	nicely. </p>
	<p>f = tau SQRT(1 + sigma^2) - sigma SQRT(1 + tau^2) - tau' = 0. </p>
	<p>Start with tau' as the initial guess for tau. Compute sigma = sinh(e 
	argtanh(e tau/SQRT(1 + tau^2)))</p>
	<p>Now we need the defivative of f. <br>df/dtau =(SQRT((1 + sigma^2)(1 + 
	tau^2)) - sigma tau)(1 - e^2)SQRT(1+tau^2)/(1 + (1 - e^2)tau^2)</p>
	<p>Estimate f using tau' as the initial guess, calculate sigma and df/dtau. 
	Estimate a new value for tau<br>tau = tau - (df/dtau)/tau, compute a new 
	value for f and keep going until f converges to zero and tau stops changing. 
	Three iterations were sufficient for me.</p>
	<p>Just to check your formulas, Karney generated a huge number of test 
	values. Here are the first ten</p>

<p>Note that all longitudes and eastings are with respect to a central meridian 
of zero degrees and zero easting. <em>Yes, these formulas are accurate to more 
than 75 degrees from the central meridian</em>. However, beyond 80 degrees, and 
at low latitudes, they can blow up in Excel.</p>







<p><strong>In response to innumerable e-mails, you <em>cannot</em> use UTM grid 
coordinates without knowing your zone. There are sixty points on the earth's 
surface that have the same numerical UTM coordinates, 120 if you consider that 
northing is duplicated in both hemispheres.</strong></p>


<h2><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180216112824/http://www.uwgb.edu:80/dutchs/UsefulData/UTMConversion2015m.xls">A Spreadsheet Program</a></h2>
<p>This program was recently updated using the formulas of Charles Karney 
(2010). His paper claims accuracy of a few nanometers. Excel has 15-digit 
accuracy, so the spreadsheet doesn't achieve that level, but is accurate to 
about 0.01mm. Most importantly, Karney's paper provides links to a site that has 
a huge set of test data. The spreadsheet has been tested against the data in 
both directions. Before linking to the program, note (<strong class="auto-style1">especially the last item</strong>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is an Excel spreadsheet. If you have Excel on your computer, it will
    (or should) open when you click the link. Most major spreadsheet programs
    can read spreadsheets in other formats.</li>
	<li>A spreadsheet is not an applet or program. In particular, you can't 
	manually enter data into a cell and preserve any formulas that are there. 
	That's why some aspects of data entry are clunkier than they might otherwise 
	be with, say, a Visual Basic program.</li>
  <li>There are three computation pages, one for single conversions, the other two
    for batch conversions. Other pages contain information on datums, test data and the 
	specific conversion formulas. To use the batch conversions you need to be somewhat
    proficient in spreadsheets as you will have to copy data and cell formulas.</li>
  <li>For our mutual peace of mind, run a virus check. The spreadsheet has a 
  couple of simple macros.</li>
  <li>You may copy the program for your own non-commercial use and for
    non-commercial distribution to others, but not for commercial use. Please 
	give appropriate credit when citing your calculations. You may
    also modify it as needed for your personal use. In Internet Explorer, right 
	click on the link and select Save Target As... to save the spreadsheet to 
	your own disk.</li>
	<li>There is now a Javascript Page which I hope is free of bugs. Since it's a program, it should handle complex 
	what-ifs a lot better than a spreadsheet can. All the permissions for the 
	spreadsheet apply here, too. Persistent bugs caused me to delete links 
	to the older spreadsheet.</li>
	<li>These pages are somewhat OBE (overtaken by events).
	<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180216112824/http://www.earthpoint.us/Convert.aspx">
	http://www.earthpoint.us/Convert.aspx</a> can convert between a variety of 
	coordinate systems and has many links to other useful pages. The National 
	Geodetic Survey has a site at
	<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180216112824/http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/spc.shtml">
	http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/spc.shtml</a> with that converts latitude and 
	longitude to State Plane Coordinates.</li>

</p><center><h1>Calendars</h1>
<p>
by L. E. Doggett</p></center>
<hr>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
A calendar is a system of organizing units of time for the purpose of reckoning
time over extended periods. By convention, the day is the smallest calendrical
unit of time; the measurement of fractions of a day is classified as 
timekeeping. The generality of this definition is due to the diversity of 
methods that have been used in creating calendars. Although some calendars 
replicate astronomical cycles according to fixed rules, others are based on
abstract, perpetually repeating cycles of no astronomical significance. Some
calendars are regulated by astronomical observations, some carefully and 
redundantly enumerate every unit, and some contain ambiguities and 
discontinuities. Some calendars are codified in written laws; others are 
transmitted by oral tradition.
<p>
The common theme of calendar making is the desire to organize units of time to
satisfy the needs and preoccupations of society. In addition to serving 
practical purposes, the process of organization provides a sense, however 
illusory, of understanding and controlling time itself. Thus calendars serve as
a link between mankind and the cosmos. It is little wonder that calendars have
held a sacred status and have served as a source of social order and cultural
identity. Calendars have provided the basis for planning agricultural, hunting,
and migration cycles, for divination and prognostication, and for maintaining
cycles of religious and civil events. Whatever their scientific sophistication,
calendars must ultimately be judged as social contracts, not as scientific
treatises.
</p><p>
According to a recent estimate (Fraser, 1987), there are about forty calendars
used in the world today. This chapter is limited to the half-dozen principal
calendars in current use. Furthermore, the emphasis of the chapter is on
function and calculation rather than on culture. The fundamental bases of the
calendars are given, along with brief historical summaries. Although algorithms
are given for correlating these systems, close examination reveals that even 
the standard calendars are subject to local variation. With the exception of 
the Julian calendar, this chapter does not deal with extinct systems. Inclusion
of the Julian calendar is justified by its everyday use in historical studies.
</p><p>
Despite a vast literature on calendars, truly authoritative references,
particularly in English, are difficult to find. Aveni (1989) surveys a broad 
variety of calendrical systems, stressing their cultural contexts rather than
their operational details. Parise (1982) provides useful, though not infallible,
tables for date conversion. Fotheringham (1935) and the <em>Encyclopedia of
Religion and Ethics</em> (1910), in its section on "Calendars," offer basic
information on historical calendars. The sections on "Calendars" and 
"Chronology" in all editions of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> provide
useful historical surveys. Ginzel (1906) remains an authoritative, if dated,
standard of calendrical scholarship. References on individual calendars are
given in the relevant sections.
</p><p>
</p><h3>1.1 Astronomical Bases of Calendars</h3>
The principal astronomical cycles are the day (based on the rotation of the
Earth on its axis), the year (based on the revolution of the Earth around the
Sun), and the month (based on the revolution of the Moon around the Earth). The
complexity of calendars arises because these cycles of revolution do not 
comprise an integral number of days, and because astronomical cycles are neither
constant nor perfectly commensurable with each other,
<p>
The <em>tropical year</em> is defined as the mean interval between vernal 
equinoxes; it corresponds to the cycle of the seasons. The following expression,
based on the orbital elements of Laskar (1986), is used for calculating the
length of the tropical year:
<br>
365.2421896698 - 0.00000615359 T - 7.29E-10 T^2 + 2.64E-10 T^3 [days]
<br>
where T = (JD - 2451545.0)/36525 and JD is the Julian day number. However, the
interval from a particular vernal equinox to the next may vary from this mean
by several minutes. 
</p><p>
The <em>synodic month</em>, the mean interval between conjunctions of the Moon
and Sun, corresponds to the cycle of lunar phases. The following expression for
the synodic month is based on the lunar theory of Chapront-Touze' and Chapront
(1988): <br>
29.5305888531 + 0.00000021621 T - 3.64E-10 T^2 [days]. <br>
Again T = (JD - 2451545.0)/36525 and JD is the Julian day number. Any particular
phase cycle may vary from the mean by up to seven hours.
</p><p>
In the preceding formulas, T is measured in Julian centuries of Terrestrial
Dynamical Time (TDT), which is independent of the variable rotation of the 
Earth. Thus, the lengths of the tropical year and synodic month are here defined
in days of 86400 seconds of International Atomic Time (TAI).
</p><p>
From these formulas we see that the cycles change slowly with time. Furthermore,
the formulas should not be considered to be absolute facts; they are the best
approximations possible today. Therefore, a calendar year of an integral number
of days cannot be perfectly synchronized to the tropical year. Approximate
synchronization of calendar months with the lunar phases requires a complex
sequence of months of 29 and 30 days. For convenience it is common to speak of
a lunar year of twelve synodic months, or 354.36707 days.
</p><p>
Three distinct types of calendars have resulted from this situation. A <em>solar
calendar</em>, of which the Gregorian calendar in its civil usage is an example,
is designed to maintain synchrony with the tropical year. To do so, days are
intercalated (forming leap years) to increase the average length of the calendar
year. A <em>lunar calendar</em>, such as the Islamic calendar, follows the 
lunar phase cycle without regard for the tropical year. Thus the months of the
Islamic calendar systematically shift with respect to the months of the 
Gregorian calendar. The third type of calendar, the <em>lunisolar calendar</em>,
has a sequence of months based on the lunar phase cycle; but every few years a
whole month is intercalated to bring the calendar back in phase with the 
tropical year. The Hebrew and Chinese calendars are examples of this type of
calendar.
</p><p>
</p><h3>1.2 Nonastronomical Bases of Calendars: the Week</h3>
[omitted]
<h3>1.3 Calendar Reform and Accuracy</h3>
In most societies a calendar reform is an extraordinary event. Adoption of a
calendar depends on the forcefulness with which it is introduced and on the
willingness of society to accept it. For example, the acceptance of the
Gregorian calendar as a worldwide standard spanned more than three centuries.
<p>
The legal code of the United States does not specify an official national 
calendar. Use of the Gregorian calendar in the United States stems from an Act
of Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1751, which specified use of the
Gregorian calendar in England and its colonies. However, its adoption in the
United Kingdom and other countries was fraught with confusion, controversy, and
even violence (Bates, 1952; Gingerich, 1983; Hoskin, 1983). It also had a 
deeper cultural impact through the disruption of traditional festivals and
calendrical practices (MacNeill, 1982).
</p><p>
Because calendars are created to serve societal needs, the question of a 
calendar's accuracy is usually misleading or misguided. A calendar that is based
on a fixed set of rules is accurate if the rules are consistently applied. For
calendars that attempt to replicate astronomical cycles, one can ask how
accurately the cycles are replicated. However, astronomical cycles are not
absolutely constant, and they are not known exactly. In the long term, only a
purely observational calendar maintains synchrony with astronomical phenomena.
However, an observational calendar exhibits short-term uncertainty, because the
natural phenomena are complex and the observations are subject to error.
</p><p> 
</p><h3>1.4 Historical Eras and Chronology</h3>
The calendars treated in this chapter, except for the Chinese calendar, have
counts of years from initial epochs. In the case of the Chinese calendar and
some calendars not included here, years are counted in cycles, with no 
particular cycle specified as the first cycle. Some cultures eschew year counts
altogether but name each year after an event that characterized the year. 
However, a count of years from an initial epoch is the most successful way of
maintaining a consistent chronology. Whether this epoch is associated with an
historical or legendary event, it must be tied to a sequence of recorded
historical events.
<p>
This is illustrated by the adoption of the birth of Christ as the initial epoch
of the Christian calendar. This epoch was established by the sixth-century
scholar Dionysius Exiguus, who was compiling a table of dates of Easter. An
existing table covered the nineteen-year period denoted 228-247, where years
were counted from the beginning of the reign of the Roman emperor Diocletian.
Dionysius continued the table for a nineteen-year period, which he designated
Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi 532-550. Thus, Dionysius' Anno Domini 532 is
equivalent to Anno Diocletian 248. In this way a correspondence was established
between the new Christian Era and an existing system associated with historical
records. What Dionysius did not do is establish an accurate date for the birth
of Christ. Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years
before A.D. 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive
dating.
</p><p>
Given an initial epoch, one must consider how to record preceding dates. Bede,
the eighth-century English historian, began the practice of counting years
backward from A.D. 1 (see Colgrave and Mynors, 1969). In this system, the year
A.D. 1 is preceded by the year 1 B.C., without an intervening year 0. Because
of the numerical discontinuity, this "historical" system is cumbersome for
comparing ancient and modern dates. Today, astronomers use +1 to designate A.D.
1. Then +1 is naturally preceded by year 0, which is preceded by year -1. Since
the use of negative numbers developed slowly in Europe, this "astronomical"
system of dating was delayed until the eighteenth century, when it was 
introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini (Cassini, 1740).
</p><p>
Even as use of Dionysius' Christian Era became common in ecclesiastical writings
of the Middle Ages, traditional dating from regnal years continued in civil use.
In the sixteenth century, Joseph Justus Scaliger tried to resolve the patchwork
of historical eras by placing everything on a single system (Scaliger, 1583).
Instead of introducing negative year counts, he sought an initial epoch in 
advance of any historical record. His numerological approach utilized three
calendrical cycles: the 28-year solar cycle, the nineteen-year cycle of Golden
Numbers, and the fifteen-year indiction cycle. The solar cycle is the period
after which weekdays and calendar dates repeat in the Julian calendar. The
cycle of Golden Numbers is the period after which moon phases repeat
(approximately) on the same calendar dates. The indiction cycle was a Roman tax
cycle. Scaliger could therefore characterize a year by the combination of
numbers (S,G,I), where S runs from 1 through 28, G from 1 through 19, and I from
1 through 15. Scaliger noted that a given combination would recur after 7980
(= 28*19*15) years. He called this a Julian Period, because it was based on the
Julian calendar year. For his initial epoch Scaliger chose the year in which
S, G, and I were all equal to 1. He knew that the year 1 B.C. was characterized
by the number 9 of the solar cycle, by the Golden Number 1, and by the number 3
of the indiction cycle, i.e., (9,1,3). He found that the combination (1,1,1)
occurred in 4713 B.C. or, as astronomers now say, -4712. This serves as year 1
of Scaliger's Julian Period. It was later adopted as the initial epoch for the
Julian day numbers.

<h2>2. The Gregorian Calendar</h2>
The Gregorian calendar today serves as an international standard for civil use.
In addition, it regulates the ceremonial cycle of the Roman Catholic and 
Protestant churches. In fact, its original purpose was ecclesiastical. Although
a variety of other calendars are in use today, they are restricted to particular
religions or cultures.
<p>
</p><h3>2.1 Rules for Civil Use</h3>
Years are counted from the initial epoch defined by Dionysius Exiguus, and are
divided into two classes: common years and leap years. A common year is 365 
days in length; a leap year is 366 days, with an intercalary day, designated
February 29, preceding March 1. Leap years are determined according to the
following rule: <br>
<center>Every year that is exactly divisible by 4 is a leap year, except for
years that are exactly divisible by 100;<br>
these centurial years are leap years
only if they are exactly divisible by 400.</center><br>
As a result the year 2000 is a leap year, whereas 1900 and 2100 are not leap 
years. These rules can be applied to times prior to the Gregorian reform to
create a proleptic Gregorian calendar. In this case, year 0 (1 B.C.) is 
considered to be exactly divisible by 4, 100, and 400; hence it is a leap year.
<p>
The Gregorian calendar is thus based on a cycle of 400 years, which comprises
146097 days. Since 146097 is evenly divisible by 7, the Gregorian civil calendar
exactly repeats after 400 years. Dividing 146097 by 400 yields an average
length of 365.2425 days per calendar year, which is a close approximation to
the length of the tropical year. Comparison with Equation 1.1-1 reveals that the
Gregorian calendar accumulates an error of one day in about 2500 years. Although
various adjustments to the leap-year system have been proposed, none has been
instituted.
</p><p>
Within each year, dates are specified according to the count of days from the
beginning of the month. The order of months and number of days per month were
adopted from the Julian calendar.
</p><p>

<p>
</p><h3>2.2 Ecclesiastical Rules</h3>
The ecclesiastical calendars of Christian churches are based on cycles of 
movable and immovable feasts. Christmas is the principal immovable feast, with
its date set at December 25. Easter is the principal movable feast, and dates
of most other movable feasts are determined with respect to Easter. However,
the movable feasts of the Advent and Epiphany seasons are Sundays reckoned
from Christmas and the Feast of the Epiphany, respectively.
<p>
In the Gregorian calendar, the date of Easter is defined to occur on the Sunday
following the ecclesiastical Full Moon that falls on or next after March 21.
This should not be confused with the popular notion that Easter is the first
Sunday after the first Full Moon following the vernal equinox. In the first 
place, the vernal equinox does not necessarily occur on March 21. In addition,
the ecclesiastical Full Moon is not the astronomical Full Moon -- it is based
on tables that do not take into account the full complexity of lunar motion. As
a result, the date of an ecclesiastical Full Moon may differ from that of the
true Full Moon. However, the Gregorian system of leap years and lunar tables
does prevent progressive departure of the tabulated data from the astronomical
phenomena.
</p><p>
The ecclesiastical Full Moon is defined as the fourteenth day of a tabular
lunation, where day 1 corresponds to the ecclesiastical New Moon. The tables 
are based on the Metonic cycle, in which 235 mean synodic months occur in 
6939.688 days. Since nineteen Gregorian years is 6939.6075 days, the dates of
Moon phases in a given year will recur on nearly the same dates nineteen years
laters. To prevent the 0.08 day difference between the cycles from accumulating,
the tables incorporate adjustments to synchronize the system over longer periods
of time. Additional complications arise because the tabular lunations are of
29 or 30 integral days. The entire system comprises a period of 5700000 years
of 2081882250 days, which is equated to 70499183 lunations. After this period,
the dates of Easter repeat themselves.
</p><p> The following algorithm for computing the date of Easter is based on the
algorithm of Oudin (1940). It is valid for any Gregorian year, Y. All variables
are integers and the remainders of all divisions are dropped. The final date is
given by M, the month, and D, the day of the month. <br>
</p><center>C = Y/100, <br>
N = Y - 19*(Y/19), <br>
K = (C - 17)/25, <br>
I = C - C/4 - (C - K)/3 + 19*N + 15, <br>
I = I - 30*(I/30), <br>
I = I - (I/28)*(1 - (I/28)*(29/(I + 1))*((21 - N)/11)), <br>
J = Y + Y/4 + I + 2 - C + C/4, <br>
J = J - 7*(J/7), <br>
L = I - J, <br>
M = 3 + (L + 40)/44, <br>
D = L + 28 - 31*(M/4). </center>
<p>
</p><h3>2.3 History of the Gregorian Calendar</h3>
The Gregorian calendar resulted from a perceived need to reform the method of
calculating dates of Easter. Under the Julian calendar the dating of Easter had
become standardized, using March 21 as the date of the equinox and the Metonic
cycle as the basis for calculating lunar phases. By the thirteenth century it
was realized that the true equinox had regressed from March 21 (its supposed
date at the time of the Council of Nicea, +325) to a date earlier in the month.
As a result, Easter was drifting away from its springtime position and was
losing its relation with the Jewish Passover. Over the next four centuries, 
scholars debated the "correct" time for celebrating Easter and the means of
regulating this time calendrically. The Church made intermittent attempts to 
solve the Easter question, without reaching a consensus.
<p>
By the sixteenth century the equinox had shifted by ten days, and astronomical
New Moons were occurring four days before ecclesiastical New Moons. At the 
behest of the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V introduced a new Breviary in 1568
and Missal in 1570, both of which included adjustments to the lunar tables and
the leap-year system. Pope Gregory XIII, who succeeded Pope Pius in 1572, soon
convened a commission to consider reform of the calendar, since he considered
his predecessor's measures inadequate.
</p><p>
The recommendations of Pope Gregory's calendar commission were instituted by 
the papal bull "Inter Gravissimus," signed on 1582 February 24. Ten days were
deleted from the calendar, so that 1582 October 4 was followed by 1582 October
15, thereby causing the vernal equinox of 1583 and subsequent years to occur
about March 21. And a new table of New Moons and Full Moons was introduced for
determining the date of Easter.
</p><p>
Subject to the logistical problems of communication and governance in the 
sixteenth century, the new calendar was promulgated through the Roman-Catholic
world. Protestant states initially rejected the calendar, but gradually 
accepted it over the coming centuries. The Eastern Orthodox churches rejected
the new calendar and continued to use the Julian calendar with traditional lunar
tables for calculating Easter. Because the purpose of the Gregorian calendar
was to regulate the cycle of Christian holidays, its acceptance in the 
non-Christian world was initially not at issue. But as international 
communications developed, the civil rules of the Gregorian calendar were
gradually adopted around the world.
</p><p>
Anyone seriously interested in the Gregorian calendar should study the 
collection of papers resulting from a conference sponsored by the Vatican to
commemorate the four-hundredth anniversary of the Gregorian Reform (Coyne et 
al., 1983).
</p><hr>
<h2>3. The Hebrew Calendar</h2>
As it exists today, the Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar that is based 
on calculation rather than observation. This calendar is the official calendar
of Israel and is the liturgical calendar of the Jewish faith.
<p>
In principle the beginning of each month is determined by a tabular New Moon
(<em>molad</em>) that is based on an adopted mean value of the lunation cycle.
To ensure that religious festivals occur in appropriate seasons, months are
intercalated according to the Metonic cycle, in which 235 lunations occur in
nineteen years.
</p><p>
By tradition, days of the week are designated by number, with only the seventh
day, Sabbath, having a specific name. Days are reckoned from sunset to sunset,
so that day 1 begins at sunset on Saturday and ends at sunset on Sunday. The
Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday and ends at sunset on Saturday.
</p><p>
</p><h3>3.1 Rules</h3>
Years are counted from the Era of Creation, or Era Mundi, which corresponds to
-3760 October 7 on the Julian proleptic calendar. Each year consists of twelve
or thirteen months, with months consisting of 29 or 30 days. An intercalary
month is introduced in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 in a nineteen-year
cycle of 235 lunations. The initial year of the calendar, A.M. (Anno Mundi) 1,
is year 1 of the nineteen-year cycle.
<p>
The calendar for a given year is established by determining the day of the week
of Tishri 1 (first day of Rosh Hashanah or New Year's Day) and the number of
days in the year. Years are classified according to the number of days in the
year (see Table 3.1.1).

1 <em>Tishri</em> until after the <em>molad</em>. </td></tr>
</tbody></table> </p></center>
<p></p><hr align="center" width="50%"><p>
The months of Heshvan and Kislev vary in length to satisfy requirements for the
length of the year (see Table 3.1.1). In leap years, the 29-day month Adar is
designated Adar II, and is preceded by the 30-day intercalary month Adar I.
</p><p>
For calendrical calculations, the day begins at 6 P.M., which is designated 0
hours. Hours are divided into 1080 <em>halakim</em>; thus one <em>helek</em> is
3 1/3 seconds. (Terminology is explained in Table 3.1.3.) Calendrical 
calculations are referred to the meridian of Jerusalem -- 2 hours 21 minutes
east of Greenwich.
</p><p>
Rules for constructing the Hebrew calendar are given in the sections that 
follow. Cohen (1981), Resnikoff (1943), and Spier (1952) provide reliable guides
to the rules of calculation.
</p><p>
</p><h4>3.1.1 Determining Tishri 1</h4>
The calendar year begins with the first day of Rosh Hashanah (Tishri 1). This
is determined by the day of the Tishri <em>molad</em> and the four rules of
postponements (<em>dehiyyot</em>). The <em>dehiyyot</em> can postpone Tishri 1
until one or two days following the <em>molad</em>. Tabular new moons 
(<em>maladot</em>) are reckoned from the Tishri <em>molad</em> of the year A.M.
1, which occurred on day 2 at 5 hours, 204 <em>halakim</em> (i.e., 11:11:20 
P.M. on Sunday, -3760 October 6, Julian proleptic calendar). The adopted value 
of the mean lunation is 29 days, 12 hours, 793 <em>halakim</em> (29.530594 
days). To avoid rounding and truncation errors, calculation should be done in
<em>halakim</em> rather than decimals of a day, since the adopted lunation
constant is expressed exactly in <em>halakim</em>.

<p>
Lunation constants required in calculations are shown in Table 3.1.1.1. By 
subtracting off the weeks, these constants give the shift in weekdays that
occurs after each cycle.
</p><p>
The <em>dehiyyot</em> are as follows: <br>
(a) If the Tishri <em>molad</em> falls on day 1, 4, or 6, then Tishri 1 is
postponed one day. <br>
(b) If the Tishri <em>molad</em> occurs at or after 18 hours (i.e., noon), then
Tishri 1 is postponed one day. If this causes Tishri 1 to fall on day 1, 4, or 
6, then Tishri 1 is postponed an additional day to satisfy <em>dehiyyah</em>
(a). <br>
(c) If the Tishri <em>molad</em> of an ordinary year (i.e., of twelve months)
falls on day 3 at or after 9 hours, 204 <em>halakim</em>, then Tishri 1 is
postponed two days to day 5, thereby satisfying <em>dehiyyah</em> (a). <br>
(d) If the first <em>molad</em> following a leap year falls on day 2 at or after
15 hours, 589 <em>halakim</em>, then Tishri 1 is postponed one day to day 3.
</p><p>
</p><h4>3.1.2 Reasons for the <em>Dehiyyot</em></h4>
<em>Dehiyyah</em> (a) prevents Hoshana Rabba (Tishri 21) from occurring on the
Sabbath and prevents Yom Kippur (Tishri 10) from occurring on the day before or
after the Sabbath.
<p>
<em>Dehiyyah</em> (b) is an artifact of the ancient practice of beginning each
month with the sighting of the lunar crescent. It is assumed that if the 
<em>molad</em> (i.e., the mean conjunction) occurs after noon, the lunar 
crescent cannot be sighted until after 6 P.M., which will then be on the
following day.
</p><p> 
<em>Dehiyyah</em> (c) prevents an ordinary year from exceeding 355 days. If the
Tishri <em>molad</em> of an ordinary year occurs on Tuesday at or after 
3:11:20 A.M., the next Tishri <em>molad</em> will occur at or after noon on
Saturday. According to <em>dehiyyah</em> (b), Tishri 1 of the next year must be
postponed to Sunday, which by <em>dehiyyah</em> (a) occasions a further
postponement to Monday. This results in an ordinary year of 356 days. Postponing
Tishri 1 from Tuesday to Thursday produces a year of 354 days.
</p><p>
<em>Dehiyyah</em> (d) prevents a leap year from falling short of 383 days. If 
the Tishri <em>molad</em> following a leap year is on Monday, at or after 
9:32:43 1/3 A.M., the previous Tishri <em>molad</em> (thirteen months earlier)
occurred on Tuesday at or after noon. Therefore, by <em>dehiyyot</em> (b) and
(a), Tishri 1 beginning the leap year was postponed to Thursday. To prevent a
leap year of 382 days, <em>dehiyyah</em> (d) postpones by one day the 
beginning of the ordinary year.
</p><p>
A thorough discussion of both the functional and religious aspects of the
<em>dehiyyot</em> is provided by Cohen (1981).
</p><p>
</p><h4>3.1.3 Determining the Length of the Year</h4>
An ordinary year consists of 50 weeks plus 3, 4, or 5 days. The number of excess
days identifies the year as being deficient, regular, or complete, respectively.
A leap year consists of 54 weeks plus 5, 6, or 7 days, which again are
designated deficient, regular, or complete, respectively. The length of a year
can therefore be determined by comparing the weekday of Tishri 1 with that of
the next Tishri 1.
<p>
First consider an ordinary year. The weekday shift after twelve lunations is
04-08-876. For example if a Tishri <em>molad</em> of an ordinary year occurs on
day 2 at 0 hours 0 <em>halakim</em> (6 P.M. on Monday), the next Tishri
<em>molad</em> will occur on day 6 at 8 hours 876 <em>halakim</em>. The first
Tishri <em>molad</em> does not require application of the <em>dehiyyot</em>, so
Tishri 1 occurs on day 2. Because of <em>dehiyyah</em> (a), the following 
Tishri 1 is delayed by one day to day 7, five weekdays after the previous Tishri
1. Since this characterizes a complete year, the months of Heshvan and Kislev
both contain 30 days.
</p><p>
The weekday shift after thirteen lunations is 05-21-589. If the Tishri <em>molad
</em> of a leap year occurred on day 4 at 20 hours 500 <em>halakim</em>, the
next Tishri <em>molad</em> will occur on day 3 at 18 hours 9 <em>halakim</em>.
Becuase of <em>dehiyyot</em> (b), Tishri 1 of the leap year is postponed two
days to day 6. Because of <em>dehiyyot</em> (c), Tishri 1 of the following year
is postponed two days to day 5. This six-day difference characterizes a regular
year, so that Heshvan has 29 days and Kislev has 30 days.
</p><p>
</p><h3>3.2 History of the Hebrew Calendar</h3>
The codified Hebrew calendar as we know it today is generally considered to date
from A.M. 4119 (+359), though the exact date is uncertain. At that time the
patriarch Hillel II, breaking with tradition, disseminated rules for calculating
the calendar. Prior to that time the calendar was regarded as a secret science
of the religious authorities. The exact details of Hillel's calendar have not
come down to us, but it is generally considered to include rules for 
intercalation over nineteen-year cycles. Up to the tenth century A.D., however,
there was disagreement about the proper years for intercalation and the initial
epoch for reckoning years.
<p>
Information on calendrical practices prior to Hillel is fragmentary and often
contradictory. The earliest evidence indicates a calendar based on observations
of Moon phases. Since the Bible mentions seasonal festivals, there must have
been intercalation. There was likely an evolution of conflicting calendrical
practices.
</p><p>
The Babylonian exile, in the first half of the sixth century B.C., greatly 
influenced the Hebrew calendar. This is visible today in the names of the 
months. The Babylonian influence may also have led to the practice of 
intercalating leap months.
</p><p>
During the period of the Sanhedrin, a committee of the Sanhedrin met to evaluate
reports of sightings of the lunar crescent. If sightings were not possible, the
new month was begun 30 days after the beginning of the previous month. Decisions
on intercalation were influenced, if not determined entirely, by the state of
vegetation and animal life. Although eight-year, nineteen-year, and longer-
period intercalation cycles may have been instituted at various times prior to
Hillel II, there is little evidence that they were employed consistently over
long time spans.
</p><hr>
<h2>4. The Islamic Calendar</h2>
The Islamic calendar is a purely lunar calendar in which months correspond to
the lunar phase cycle. As a result, the cycle of twelve lunar months regresses
through the seasons over a period of about 33 years. For religious purposes,
Muslims begin the months with the first visibility of the lunar crescent after
conjunction. For civil purposes a tabulated calendar that approximates the
lunar phase cycle is often used.
<p>
The seven-day week is observed with each day beginning at sunset. Weekdays are
specified by number, with day 1 beginning at sunset on Saturday and ending at
sunset on Sunday. Day 5, which is called Jum'a, is the day for congregational
prayers. Unlike the Sabbath days of the Christians and Jews, however, Jum'a is
not a day of rest. Jum'a begins at sunset on Thursday and ends at sunset on
Friday. [Erratum: It appears that Doggett should have stated that Jum'a is
Day 6, not Day 5.]
</p><p>
</p><h3>4.1 Rules</h3>
Years of twelve lunar months are reckoned from the Era of the Hijra, 
commemorating the migration of the Prophet and his followers from Mecca to 
Medina. This epoch, 1 A.H. (Anno Higerae) Muharram 1, is generally taken by
astronomers (Neugebauer, 1975) to be Thursday, +622 July 15 (Julian calendar).
This is called the astronomical Hijra epoch. Chronological tables (e.g., Mayr
and Spuler, 1961; Freeman-Grenville, 1963) generally use Friday, July 16, which
is designated the civil epoch. In both cases the Islamic day begins at sunset
of the previous day.
<p>
For religious purposes, each month begins in principle with the first sighting
of the lunar crescent after the New Moon. This is particularly important for
establishing the beginning and end of Ramadan. Because of uncertainties due to
weather, however, a new month may be declared thirty days after the beginning 
of the preceding month. Although various predictive procedures have been used
for determining first visibility, they have always had an equivocal status. In
practice, there is disagreement among countries, religious leaders, and
scientists about whether to rely on observations, which are subject to error, 
or to use calculations, which may be based on poor models.
</p><p>
Chronologists employ a thirty-year cyclic calendar in studying Islamic history.
In this tabular calendar, there are eleven leap years in the thirty-year cycle.
Odd-numbered months have thirty days and even-numbered months have twenty-nine
days, with a thirtieth day added to the twelfth month, Dhu al-Hijjah (see
Table 4.1.1). Years 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, and 29 of the cycle
are designated leap years. This type of calendar is also used as a civil
calendar in some Muslim countries, though other years are sometimes used as 
leap years. The mean length of the month of the thirty-year tabular calendar is
about 2.9 seconds less than the synodic period of the Moon.

</p><h4>4.1.1 Visibility of the Crescent Moon</h4>
[omitted]
<p>
</p><h3>4.2 History of the Islamic Calendar</h3>
The form of the Islamic calendar, as a lunar calendar without intercalation, was
laid down by the Prophet in the Qur'an (Sura IX, verse 36-37) and in his sermon
at the Farewell Pilgrimage. This was a departure from the lunisolar calendar
commonly used in the Arab world, in which months were based on first sightings
of the lunar crescent, but an intercalary month was added as deemed necessary.
<p>
Caliph 'Umar I is credited with establishing the Hijra Era in A.H. 17. It is
not known how the initial date was determined. However, calculations show that
the astronomical New Moon (i.e., conjunction) occurred on +622 July 14 at 0444
UT (assuming delta-T = 1.0 hour), so that sighting of the crescent most likely
occurred on the evening of July 16.
</p><hr>
<h2>5. The Indian Calendar</h2>
As a result of a calendar reform in A.D. 1957, the National Calendar of India 
is a formalized lunisolar calendar in which leap years coincide with those of
the Gregorian calendar (Calendar Reform Committee, 1957). However, the initial
epoch is the Saka Era, a traditional epoch of Indian chronology. Months are
named after the traditional Indian months and are offset from the beginning of
Gregorian months (see Table 5.1.1).
<p>
In addition to establishing a civil calendar, the Calendar Reform Committee set
guidelines for religious calendars, which require calculations of the motions 
of the Sun and Moon. Tabulations of the religious holidays are prepared by the
India Meteorological Department and published annually in <em>The Indian
Astronomical Ephemeris</em>.
</p><p>
Despite the attempt to establish a unified calendar for all of India, many local
variations exist. The Gregorian calendar continues in use for administrative
purposes, and holidays are still determined according to regional, religious,
and ethnic traditions (Chatterjee, 1987).
</p><p>
</p><h3>5.1 Rules for Civil Use</h3>
Years are counted from the Saka Era; 1 Saka is considered to begin with the
vernal equinox of A.D. 79. The reformed Indian calendar began with Saka Era 
1879, Caitra 1, which corresponds to A.D. 1957 March 22. Normal years have 365 
days; leap years have 366. In a leap year, an intercalary day is added to the
end of Caitra. To determine leap years, first add 78 to the Saka year. If this
sum is evenly divisible by 4, the year is a leap year, unless the sum is a 
multiple of 100. In the latter case, the year is not a leap year unless the sum
is also a multiple of 400. Table 5.1.1 gives the sequence of months and their
correlation with the months of the Gregorian calendar.

</center><p>
</p><h3>5.2 Principles of the Religious Calendar</h3>
Religious holidays are determined by a lunisolar calendar that is based on
calculations of the actual postions of the Sun and Moon. Most holidays occur on
specified lunar dates (<em>tithis</em>), as is explained later; a few occur on
specified solar dates. The calendrical methods presented here are those 
recommended by the Calendar Reform Committee (1957). They serve as the basis
for the calendar published in <em>The Indian Astronomical Ephemeris</em>. 
However, many local calendar makers continue to use traditional astronomical
concepts and formulas, some of which date back 1500 years.
<p>
The Calendar Reform Committee attempted to reconcile traditional calendrical
practices with modern astronomical concepts. According to their proposals, 
precession is accounted for and calculations of solar and lunar position are
based on accurate modern methods. All astronomical calculations are performed
with respect to a Central Station at longitude 82o30' East, latitude 23o11'
North. For religious purposes solar days are reckoned from sunrise to sunrise. 
</p><p>
A solar month is defined as the interval required for the Sun's apparent 
longitude to increase by 30o, corresponding to the passage of the Sun through
a zodiacal sign (<em>rasi</em>). The initial month of the year, Vaisakha, 
begins when the true longitude of the Sun is 23o 15' (see Table 5.2.1). Because
the Earth's orbit is elliptical, the lengths of the months vary from 29.2 to
31.2 days. The short months all occur in the second half of the year around
the time of the Earth's perihelion passage.

</tbody></table></center><p>
Lunar months are measured from one New Moon to the next (although some groups
reckon from the Full Moon). Each lunar month is given the name of the solar
month in which the lunar month begins. Because most lunations are shorter than
a solar month, there is occasionally a solar month in which two New Moons 
occur. In this case, both lunar months bear the same name, but the first month
is described with the prefix <em>adhika</em>, or intercalary. Such a year has
thirteen lunar months. <em>Adhika</em> months occur every two or three years
following patterns described by the Metonic cycle or more complex lunar phase
cycles.
</p><p>
More rarely, a year will occur in which a short solar month will pass without
having a New Moon. In that case, the name of the solar month does not occur
in the calendar for that year. Such a decayed (<em>ksaya</em>) month can occur
only in the months near the Earth's perihelion passage. In compensation, a 
month in the first half of the year will have had two New Moons, so the year
will still have twelve lunar months. <em>Ksaya</em> months are separated by as
few as nineteen years and as many as 141 years.
</p><p>
Lunations are divided into 30 <em>tithis</em>, or lunar days. Each 
<em>tithi</em> is defined by the time required for the longitude of the Moon to
increase by 12o over the longitude of the Sun. Thus the length of a 
<em>tithi</em> may vary from about 20 hours to nearly 27 hours. During the 
waxing phases, <em>tithis</em> are counted from 1 to 15 with the designation
<em>Sukla</em>. <em>Tithis</em> for the waning phases are designated
<em>Krsna</em> and are again counted from 1 to 15. Each day is assigned the
number of the <em>tithi</em> in effect at sunrise. Occasionally a short 
<em>tithi</em> will begin after sunrise and be completed before the next 
sunrise. Similarly a long <em>tithi</em> may span two sunrises. In the former
case, a number is omitted from the day count. In the latter, a day number is
carried over to a second day.
</p><p>
</p><h3>5.3 History of the Indian Calendar</h3>
The history of calendars in India is a remarkably complex subject owing to the
continuity of Indian civilization and to the diversity of cultural influences.
In the mid-1950s, when the Calendar Reform Committee made its survey, there 
were about 30 calendars in use for setting religious festivals for Hindus,
Buddhists, and Jainists. Some of these were also used for civil dating. These
calendars were based on common principles, though they had local characteristics
determined by long-established customs and the astronomical practices of local
calendar makers. In addition, Muslims in India used the Islamic calendar, and
the Indian government used the Gregorian calendar for administrative purposes.
<p>
Early allusions to a lunisolar calendar with intercalated months are found in
the hymns from the Rig Veda, dating from the second millennium B.C. Literature
from 1300 B.C. to A.D. 300, provides information of a more specific nature. A
five-year lunisolar calendar coordinated solar years with synodic and sidereal
lunar months.
</p><p>
Indian astronomy underwent a general reform in the first few centuries A.D., as
advances in Babylonian and Greek astronomy became known. New astronomical 
constants and models for the motion of the Moon and Sun were adapted to
traditional calendric practices. This was conveyed in astronomical treatises of
this period known as <em>Siddhantas</em>, many of which have not survived. The
<em>Surya Siddhanta</em>, which originated in the fourth century but was 
updated over the following centuries, influenced Indian calendrics up to and 
even after the calendar reform of A.D. 1957.
</p><p>
Pingree (1978) provides a survey of the development of mathematical astronomy
in India. Although he does not deal explicitly with calendrics, this material
is necessary for a full understanding of the history of India's calendars.
</p><hr>
<h2>6. The Chinese Calendar</h2>
The Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar based on calculations of the 
positions of the Sun and Moon. Months of 29 or 30 days begin on days of
astronomical New Moons, with an intercalary month being added every two or
three years. Since the calendar is based on the true positions of the Sun and
Moon, the accuracy of the calendar depends on the accuracy of the astronomical
theories and calculations.
<p>
Although the Gregorian calendar is used in the Peoples' Republic of China for
administrative purposes, the traditional Chinese calendar is used for setting
traditional festivals and for timing agricultural activities in the countryside.
The Chinese calendar is also used by Chinese communities around the world.

</p><h3>6.1 Rules</h3>
There is no specific initial epoch for counting years. In historical records,
dates were specified by counts of days and years in sexagenary cycles and by
counts of years from a succession of eras established by reigning monarchs.
<p>
The sixty-year cycle consists of a set of year names that are created by pairing
a name from a list of ten Celestial Stems with a name from a list of twelve
Terrestrial Branches, following the order specified in Table 6.1.1. The 
Celestial Stems are specified by Chinese characters that have no English 
translation; the Terrestrial Branches are named after twelve animals. After six
repetitions of the set of stems and five repetitions of the branches, a complete
cycle of pairs is completed and a new cycle begins. The initial year (jia-zi)
of the current cycle began on 1984 February 2.
</p><p>
Days are measured from midnight to midnight. The first day of a calendar month 
is the day on which the astronomical New Moon (i.e., conjunction) is calculated
to occur. Since the average interval between successive New Moons is
approximately 29.53 days, months are 29 or 30 days long. Months are specified
by number from 1 to 12. When an intercalary month is added, it bears the 
number of the previous month, but is designated as intercalary. An ordinary
year of twelve months is 353, 354, or 355 days in length; a leap year of 
thirteen months is 383, 384, or 385 days long.
</p><p>
The conditions for adding an intercalary month are determined by the occurrence
of the New Moon with respect to divisions of the tropical year. The tropical
year is divided into 24 solar terms, in 15o segments of solar longitude. These
divisions are paired into twelve Sectional Terms (<em>Jieqi</em>) and twelve
Principal Terms (<em>Zhongqi</em>), as shown in Table 6.1.2. These terms are 
numbered and assigned names that are seasonal or meteorological in nature. For
convenience here, the Sectional and Principal Terms are denoted by S and P,
respectively, followed by the number. Because of the ellipticity of the Earth's
orbit, the interval between solar terms varies with the seasons.
</p><p>
Reference works give a variety of rules for establishing New Year's Day and for
intercalation in the lunisolar calendar. Since the calendar was originally based
on the assumption that the Sun's motion was uniform through the seasons, the
published rules are frequently inadequate to handle special cases.
</p><p>
The following rules (Liu and Stephenson, in press) are currently used as the 
basis for calendars prepared by the Purple Mountain Observatory (1984): <br>
(1) The first day of the month is the day on which the New Moon occurs. <br>
(2) An ordinary year has twelve lunar months; an intercalary year has thirteen
lunar months. <br>
(3) The Winter Solstice (term P-11) always falls in month 11. <br>
(4) In an intercalary year, a month in which there is no Principal Term is the
intercalary month. It is assigned the number of the preceding month, with the
further designation of intercalary. If two months of an intercalary year
contain no Principal Term, only the first such month after the Winter Solstice
is considered intercalary. <br>
(5) Calculations are based on the meridian 120o East. 
</p><p>
The number of the month usually corresponds to the number of the Principal Term
occurring during the month. In rare instances, however, there are months that
have two Principal Terms, with the result that a nonintercalary month will have
no Principal Term. As a result the numbers of the months will temporarily fail
to correspond to the numbers of the Principal Terms. These cases can be resolved
by strictly applying rules 2 and 3.

In general, the first step in calculating the Chinese calendar is to check for
the existence of an intercalary year. This can be done by determining the dates
of Winter Solstice and month 11 before and after the period of interest, and
then by counting the intervening New Moons.
</p><p>
Published calendrical tables are often in disagreement about the Chinese
calendar. Some of the tables are based on mean, or at least simplified, motions
of the Sun and Moon. Some are calculated for other meridians than 120o East.
Some incorporate a rule that the eleventh, twelfth, and first months are never
followed by an intercalary month. This is sometimes not stated as a rule, but
as a consequence of the rapid change in the Sun's longitude when the Earth is
near perihelion. However, this statement is incorrect when the motions of the
Sun and Moon are accurately calculated.
</p><p>
</p><h3>6.2 History of the Chinese Calendar</h3>
In China the calendar was a sacred document, spopnsored and promulgated by the
reigning monarch. For more than two millennia, a Bureau of Astronomy made 
astronomical observations, calculated astronomical events such as eclipses,
prepared astrological predictions, and maintained the calendar (Needham, 1959).
After all, a successful calendar not only served practical needs, but also
confirmed the consonance between Heaven and the imperial court.
<p>
Analysis of surviving astronomical records inscribed on oracle bones reveals a
Chinese lunisolar calendar, with intercalation of lunar months, dating back to
the Shang dynasty of the fourteenth century B.C. Various intercalation schemes
were developed for the early calendars, including the nineteen-year and 76-year
lunar phase cycles that came to be known in the West as the Metonic cycle and
Callipic cycle.
</p><p>
From the earliest records, the beginning of the year occurred at a New Moon 
near the winter solstice. The choice of month for beginning the civil year 
varied with time and place, however. In the late second century B.C., a calendar
reform established the practice, which continues today, of requiring the winter 
solstice to occur in month 11. This reform also introduced the intercalation 
system in which dates of New Moons are compared with the 24 solar terms. 
However, calculations were based on the mean motions resulting from the cyclic 
relationships. Inequalities in the Moon's motions were incorporated as early as 
the seventh century A.D. (Sivin, 1969), but the Sun's mean longitude was used 
for calculating the solar terms until 1644 (Liu and Stephenson, in press).
</p><p>
Years were counted from a succession of eras established by reigning emperors.
Although the accession of an emperor would mark a new era, an emperor might
also declare a new era at various times within his reign. The introduction of a
new era was an attempt to reestablish a broken connection between Heaven and
Earth, as personified by the emperor. The break might be revealed by the death
of an emperor, the occurrence of a natural disaster, or the failure of 
astronomers to predict a celestial event such as an eclipse. In the latter case,
a new era might mark the introduction of new astronomical or calendrical models.
</p><p>
Sexagenary cycles were used to count years, months, days, and fractions of a 
day using the set of Celestial Stems and Terrestrial Branches described in
Section 6.1. Use of the sixty-day cycle is seen in the earliest astronomical
records. By contrast the sixty-year cycle was introduced in the first century
A.D. or possibly a century earlier (Tung, 1960; Needham, 1959). Although the
day count has fallen into disuse in everyday life, it is still tabulated in
calendars. The initial year (jia-zi) of the current year cycle began on 1984
February 2, which is the third day (bing-yin) of the day cycle.
</p><p>
Western (pre-Copernican) astronomical theories were introduced to China by
Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth century. Gradually, more modern Western
concepts became known. Following the revolution of 1911, the traditional 
practice of counting years from the accession of an emperor was abolished.

<h2>8. The Julian Calendar</h2>
The Julian calendar, introduced by Juliius Caesar in -45, was a solar calendar
with months of fixed lengths. Every fourth year an intercalary day was added to
maintain synchrony between the calendar year and the tropical year. It served
as a standard for European civilization until the Gregorian Reform of +1582.
<p>
Today the principles of the Julian calendar continue to be used by 
chronologists. The Julian proleptic calendar is formed by applying the rules of
the Julian calendar to times before Caesar's reform. This provides a simple
chronological system for correlating other calendars and serves as the basis for
the Julian day numbers.
</p><p>
</p><h3>8.1 Rules</h3>
Years are classified as normal years of 365 days and leap years of 366 days. 
Leap years occur in years that are evenly divisible by 4. For this purpose, 
year 0 (or 1 B.C.) is considered evenly divisible by 4. The year is divided 
into twelve formalized months that were eventually adopted for the Gregorian
calendar.
<p>
</p><h3>8.2 History of the Julian Calendar</h3>
The year -45 has been called the "year of confusion," because in that year
Julius Caesar inserted 90 days to bring the months of the Roman calendar back
to their traditional place with respect to the seasons. This was Caesar's first
step in replacing a calendar that had gone badly awry. Although the pre-Julian
calendar was lunisolar in inspiration, its months no longer followed the lunar
phases and its year had lost step with the cycle of seasons (see Michels, 1967;
Bickerman, 1974). Following the advice of Sosigenes, an Alexandrine astronomer,
Caesar created a solar calendar with twelve months of fixed lengths and a 
provision for an intercalary day to be added every fourth year. As a result,
the average length of the Julian calendar year was 365.25 days. This is 
consistent with the length of the tropical year as it was known at the time.
<p>
Following Caesar's death, the Roman calendrical authorities misapplied the
leap-year rule, with the result that every third, rather than every fourth, 
year was intercalary. Although detailed evidence is lacking, it is generally
believed that Emperor Augustus corrected the situation by omitting intercalation
from the Julian years -8 through +4. After this the Julian calendar finally
began to function as planned.
</p><p>
Through the Middle Ages the use of the Julian calendar evolved and acquired
local peculiarities that continue to snare the unwary historian. There were
variations in the initial epoch for counting years, the date for beginning the
year, and the method of specifying the day of the month. Not only did these
vary with time and place, but also with purpose. Different conventions were
sometimes used for dating ecclesiastical records, fiscal transactions, and
personal correspondence.
</p><p>
Caesar designated January 1 as the beginning of the year. However, other 
conventions flourished at different times and places. The most popular 
alternatives were March 1, March 25, and December 25. This continues to cause
problems for historians, since, for example, +998 February 28 as recorded in a
city that began its year on March 1, would be the same day as +999 February 28
of a city that began the year on January 1.
</p><p>
Days within the month were originally counted from designated division points
within the month: Kalends, Nones, and Ides. The Kalends is the first day of the
month. The Ides is the thirteenth of the month, except in March, May, July, and
October, when it is the fifteenth day. The Nones is always eight days before 
the Ides (see Table 8.2.1). Dates falling between these division points are
designated by counting inclusively backward from the upcoming division point.
Intercalation was performed by repeating the day VI Kalends March, i.e., 
inserting a day between VI Kalends March (February 24) and VII Kalends March
(February 23).
</p><p>
By the eleventh century, consecutive counting of days from the beginning of the
month came into use. Local variations continued, however, including counts of
days from dates that commemorated local saints. The inauguration and spread of
the Gregorian calendar resulted in the adoption of a uniform standard for
recording dates.
</p><p>
Cappelli (1930), Grotefend and Grotefend (1941), and Cheney (1945) offer 
guidance through the maze of medieval dating.
